                <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>

                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

            <h3>Homemade Apple Pie</h3>
            <p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 1 hour 15 minutes (plus chilling time for crust)</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For the Crust:</strong></li>
                <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
                <li>½ cup ice water (approximately)</li>
                <li><strong>For the Filling:</strong></li>
                <li>6-8 medium apples (such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a mix), peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
                <li>¾ cup granulated sugar (adjust to apple sweetness)</li>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar (for sprinkling)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.</li>
                <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing lightly until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to add too much water.</li>
                <li>Divide dough in half, form into two discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat apples evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edges if necessary.</li>
                <li>Pour the apple filling into the crust-lined pie plate. Dot the top of the filling with the small pieces of butter.</li>
                <li>Roll out the second disc of dough. You can either place it as a full top crust (cut vents for steam) or cut it into strips for a lattice top.</li>
                <li>If using a full crust, place it over the filling, trim and crimp the edges to seal. If using lattice, arrange strips over filling, weaving them, and crimp edges.</li>
                <li>Brush the top crust (or lattice) with the beaten egg wash and sprinkle with the tablespoon of sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 20 minutes at 400°F (200°C). Then, reduce oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for another 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If crust edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil or a pie shield.</li>
                <li>Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving. This allows the filling to set.</li>

            <h3>Simple Roast Chicken with Herbs</h3>
            <p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 1 hour 30 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 whole chicken (about 3-4 pounds)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
                <li>1 onion, quartered (optional)</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs like parsley or thyme sprigs for stuffing (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Remove giblets from the chicken cavity if present. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels (this helps the skin crisp).</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix olive oil, salt, pepper, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and minced garlic.</li>
                <li>Rub the herb mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin of the breast if possible.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the chicken. Stuff the chicken cavity with the squeezed lemon halves, the quartered onion (if using), and fresh herb sprigs (if using).</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in a roasting pan or a large oven-safe skillet.</li>
                <li>Roast for 20 minutes at 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue roasting for another 50-70 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165°F (74°C).</li>
                <li>Baste the chicken with pan juices a couple of times during roasting if desired.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven, tent it loosely with foil, and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. This helps keep the chicken juicy.</li>
                <li>Carve and serve.</li>

                <li>1 large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced</li>
                <li>4 ripe Roma tomatoes, diced (or 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved)</li>
                <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>½ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved</li>
                <li>4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled or cubed</li>

            <h3>Quick Spaghetti Carbonara</h3>
             <p><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 25 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
                <li>4 ounces pancetta or good quality bacon, diced</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan), plus extra for serving</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta (or bacon) and cook until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add it during the last minute of cooking the pancetta. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is cooked and drained (remember to save some pasta water!), immediately add the hot spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine and coat the pasta with the rendered fat. (If the skillet is not large enough, you can do this in the warm pasta pot).</li>
                <li>Working quickly to prevent the eggs from scrambling, pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Toss continuously and vigorously. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.</li>
                <li>If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Carbonara is traditionally quite peppery.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately in warm bowls, garnished with extra Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
